# PyROQ
This is the repository for the PyROQ code that builds ROQ data for the long duration waveforms in LIGO and can be generalized to LISA as well. The code is written in Python. If you have any comments, please email hong.qi@ligo.org.

Please cite our paper if you use our code in your research. The paper will be posted on arxiv by the end of Nov 30th 2019. We will then link the paper here.
